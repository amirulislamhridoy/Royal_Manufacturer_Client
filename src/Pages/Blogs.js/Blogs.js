                    <b> How does prototypical inheritance work?</b>

                    <b> Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts</b>
                    <p>React will then look at the virtual DOM, it also has a copy of the old virtual DOM, that is why we shouldnâ€™t update the state directly, so we can have two different object references in memory, we have the old virtual DOM as well as the new virtual DOM.</p>

                    <b> You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?</b>

                    <b> What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</b>
